[Github pages][github-pages] integrates with [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] really well. So I thought I'd give it a go and see how easy it is.

There's a few interesting things you can do with the [markdown][post-docs] like `this`, and links have some interesting markup syntax that looks pretty cool.

Bloggin is really easy, you just create some simple markdown pages and [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] takes care of the rest.

I might use this blog to document some side projects. First up is seeing how easy it is to configure this [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] stuff.
