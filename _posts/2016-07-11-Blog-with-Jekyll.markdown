[Github pages][github-pages] integrates with [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] really well. So I thought I'd give it a go and see how easy it is.

[Markdown][markdown-docs] allows you to easily create posts without worrying about HTML. It's super readable and easy to modify, allowing you to focus on content.
This [Markdown cheetsheet][markdown-cheatsheet] is pretty great.

Blogging is really easy, you just create some simple markdown pages and [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] takes care of the rest.

I might use this blog to document some side projects. First up is seeing how easy it is to configure this [Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] stuff.
