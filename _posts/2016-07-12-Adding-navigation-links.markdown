[Jekyll][jekyll-homepage] out of the box is pretty basic, so I looked around for some ways to customise it and add extra functionality.

I decided that if I wanted to do a blog I'd need some way to page through all the blog posts. It doesn't add much right now as there are only 2 posts, but it should make the site a lot easier to navigate.

Using `page.previous.url` and `page.previous.title` was all it took.

Check out [this post by David Elbe][next-previous-blog-post]. It was really helpful.
